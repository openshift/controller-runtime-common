# This script verifies that the Go directive in go.mod files does not exceed
# a specified maximum version. It recursively searches for all go.mod files
# and checks that their Go version is at or below the provided maximum.
# This is used to avoid that the Go version is inadvertenly bumped by
# dependencies.
#
# Usage: ./verify-go-directive.sh -g <maximum_version>
# Example: ./verify-go-directive.sh -g 1.21
