# This script installs a Go module binary to GOBIN with version suffix. It
# removes any existing binary, installs the specified version, renames it
# with a version suffix, and creates a symlink to the versioned binary.
#
# Usage: ./go_install.sh <module> <binary_name> <version>
# Example: ./go_install.sh golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports goimports v0.16.0
